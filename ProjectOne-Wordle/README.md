# Project 1 - Wordle 

Submitted by: Jay Noppone P 

Wordle is an app that lets you guess a word, and it will tell you which letters are correct or not.
If it is correct, full green means right position & letter, yellow means wrong position & correct letter

Time spent: 1.5hrs~ hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [X] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [X] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [X] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Was not reading documentation at my first attempt at this so made many mistakes, and was clueless on what I was doing. </br>
Things got better when I actually read the docs and tried to understand what each function or method did, or what a closure does and how to use it properly.
